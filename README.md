# Multiplexed Imaging and Hybrid Unmixing in Live Cells Using PIE-sFLIM

This repository contains the Python code used for the analysis and unmixing of fluorescence signals in live-cell imaging based on fluorescence lifetime and spectral phasor analysis, as described in the paper *"Multiplexed Imaging in Live Cells Using Pulsed Interleaved Excitation Spectral FLIM"* published in *Optics Express* [1]. https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-3-3290&id=545659.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the PIE-sFLIM system with an example of 16-channel raw data analysis. (a) PIE-sFLIM setup, where the two avalanche photodiode (APD) channels and the two-photon (2P) laser are for the traditional confocal and two-photon imaging. (b) 16-channel intensity with time-resolved fluorescence response (TRES) analysis for signal visualization, demonstrated on a convallaria sample with 488‚ÄÖnm excitation. (c) Representative decays curves for each spectral channel and spectrum at each pixel. The dips in the emission spectrum are due to the dichroic mirror that blocks the two potential excitation wavelengths at 560‚ÄÖnm and 650‚ÄÖnm.

## Overview

The code provides tools for:
- Calibrating lifetime and lamda phasor transformations using well-characterized dyes (e.g., fluorescein, Atto633).

  Fig. 2. (a) Lifetime phasors can be generated using the measured phase delay œÜ(œâ) and modulation m(œâ) in a frequency-domain (FD) setup. For a single species, lifetime decreases clockwise along the universal semicircle. (b) Lifetime phasors can also be obtained from time-domain decay data, after conducting Fourier transform. The FLIM image shows T24 cells stained with LysoTracker Green (3.8‚ÄÖns, green) and NucSpot488 (5‚ÄÖns, blue). (c) Lifetime phasor calibration using fluorescein (4‚ÄÖns, excited by 488‚ÄÖnm laser) for green (Em1) and orange (Em2) emission bands. (d) Lifetime phasor calibration using Atto633 (3.3‚ÄÖns, excited by 650‚ÄÖnm laser) for red (Em3) emission band. (e) ùúè phasor plot of a convallaria sample. (f) False-colored FLIM image of the convallaria. Abbreviations: Nuc, NucSpot488; Lyso, LysoTracker Green. Scale bars are 5 ¬µm.

### Key Concepts:
- **PIE-sFLIM**: Pulsed Interleaved Excitation Spectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy.
- **Phasor Transform**: A mathematical transformation that maps lifetime and spectral data into a phasor space.
- **Hybrid Unmixing**: A method combining lifetime and spectral phasors for improved unmixing of overlapping fluorescence signals using GMM.
